# Bike-Sharing-Demand-Prediction

Introduction
Over the last few decades, there has been a significant increase in the popularity of bike-sharing systems 
all over the world. This is because it is an environmentally 
sustainable, convenient and economical way of improving urban mobility. 
üéØ The goals of this project are:
1) identify key factors affecting the hourly demand for rental bikes.
2) Build an appropriate regression model to forecast the number of rental bikes required per hour.


üìñ Dataset information
-- Dataset used in this project is the Seoul Bike Share program data.
-- This dataset contains information about the total count of rented bikes at each hour,
as well as the date of observation and meteorological information (Humidity, Snowfall, Rainfall, Temperature Season, and so on) for that hour.
-- The observations in the dataset were recorded during a span of 365 days, from December 2017 to November 2018.

The Seoul Bike Dataset contains the following information:
--Date - The date of each observation in the format 'year-month-day'
--Hour - Hour of the day
--Temperature - Temperature recorded in the city in Celsius (¬∞C).
--Humidity - Relative humidity in %
--Wind speed - Speed of the wind in m/s
--Visibility - measure of distance at which object or light can be clearly discerned in units of 10m
--Dew point temperature - Temperature recorded in the beginning of the day in Celsius(¬∞C).
--Solar radiation - Intensity of sunlight in MJ/m^2
--Rainfall - Amount of rainfall received in mm
--Snowfall - Amount of snowfall received in cm
--Seasons - Season of the year (Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn)
--Holiday - Whether the day is a Holiday or not (Holiday/No holiday)
--Functional Day -Whether the rental service is available (Yes-Functional hours) or not (No-Non functional hours)
--Rented Bike count - Count of bikes rented at each hour (target variable)

üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies used
--The programming language used in this project is Python . 
--The following libraries were used for data analysis and data visualization and to build a classifier to predict the price range of mobile phones.
1) Pandas : For loading the dataset and performing data wrangling
2) Matplotlib: For data visualization.
3) Seaborn: For data visualization.
4) NumPy: For some math operations in predictions.
5) Sklearn: For the purpose of analysis,prediction and evaluation.

üìë Steps involved
1) Data Preprocessing : Checked for outliers, incorrect values, missing values, duplicates and performed data type correction.
2) Feature Extraction : Created new columns such as Day, Month, Year, Days_of_week and Weekend from Date column.
3) Exploratory Data Analysis : Performed Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate analysis with various graphs and plots to better understand the distribution of features and their relationships.
4) Feature Selection : Checked the VIF value (measure of multicollinearity) and dropped Dew point Temperature and Year which were highly correlated with other independent features.
5) Feature encoding : 
6) Feature Scaling : Brought features to a similar range using MinmaxScaler.
7) Implementation of Regression models
8) Hyperparameter tuning
9) Comparison of models

üíª Algorithms used
1) Linear Regression
2) Polynomial Reg
3) Decision Tree
4) Random Forest
5) XGBoost
6) Gradient Boosting ‚Üí The Gradient Boosting Regressor model performed the best among the tested models, with the lowest Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error, and the highest R-squared score.

Conclusion---
-- Findings from EDA:
A) Temperature and Hour have a strong correlation with the count of rented bikes.
B) Dew point temperature is highly positively correlated to the Temperature.
C) Over the weekend and during holidays, rental bike demand decreases.
D) There is a significant drop in the number of rented bikes during Winters(Dec-Feb) because it's freezing cold!
E) The demand for bikes increases during warmer temperatures,which is why there's maximum count of rented bikes during the Summer season.
